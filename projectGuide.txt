Project Guide
==============

1. Install CMake
----------------
CMake is required to generate Visual Studio solutions.

- Download the latest version here:
  https://cmake.org/download/

- During installation:
  - Choose "Add CMake to system PATH".
  - Verify installation:
    ```powershell
    cmake --version
    ```

2. Regenerating the Visual Studio 2022 Solution
-----------------------------------------------
1. Open **Developer PowerShell for VS 2022** (or normal PowerShell).
2. Navigate to the project root folder (where `CMakeLists.txt` is located):
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\project
   ```
3. Create a `build` directory (if not already present):
   ```powershell
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution:
   ```powershell
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
   ```
   - `..` tells CMake to look at the parent folder for `CMakeLists.txt`.
   - This will generate `giraphics.sln` inside the `build` folder.

5. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
   ```powershell
   start giraphics..sln
   ```

Important!

Use the clean.bat file then run the run.bat file for editor Mode (Offline)
Use the clean.bat file run run_game.bat for non editor mode in release mode (Offline)

3. PROJECT SETTINGS (DEBUG VS RELEASE)
--------------------------------------
Once the solution is open in Visual Studio, you can toggle between configurations using the dropdown menu in the top toolbar.

* **Debug Mode:** - Use this for development.
  - Features: Unoptimized code, full debug symbols, and enables console logging/assertions.
  - Performance: Slower.
  - able to use F9 for Crash logging
  -F1 to show performance panel

* **Release Mode:**
  - Use this for final deployment or performance testing.
  - Features: Fully optimized code. Debug logs may be disabled.
  - Performance: Runs at maximum speed.
    -F1 to show performance panel
  

Real-time (in-game) editor
Toggle at runtime: Press F10 to show/hide the editor panels.
Toggle F11 to minimize screen/fullscreen



That's it — the project is ready to build and run in Visual Studio 2022.
